# Copilot Project Instructions – Mistral-Hackathon-NYC

## Project Purpose

This repository contains an AI agent built for the Mistral Worldwide Hackathon in NYC. The agent uses:

- Mistral models via Hugging Face or Mistral API
- NVIDIA NeMo Agent Toolkit for orchestration
- Weights & Biases for experiment and agent eval tracking
- ElevenLabs for text-to-speech and (optionally) speech-to-text

## Coding Conventions

- Use Python 3.11.
- Place agent orchestration code in the `agents/` package.
- Place tools (API wrappers, utilities) in `agents/tools.py` or a dedicated `tools/` package.
- Load configuration from `agents/config.yaml` using environment variables for secrets.
- Prefer async I/O for network calls when possible.

## What Copilot Should Prioritize

1. Implement and improve agent workflows (planning, tool use, error handling).
2. Generate wrappers for NVIDIA NeMo Agent Toolkit, Hugging Face Hub, ElevenLabs, and W&B.
3. Write tests first when files are under `tests/`.
4. Suggest docstrings and README snippets that explain how to run the agent and demos.

## What Copilot Should Avoid

- Do not hard-code API keys or secrets.
- Do not invent external API endpoints; follow existing patterns in `agents/tools.py`.
- Do not change the public CLI or HTTP interface without comments explaining the change.
